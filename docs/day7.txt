# Load Testing Results & Cost Analysis

## Infrastructure Capacity

### e2-micro ($7/month)
- **Max users:** 10 concurrent
- **Max RPS:** 3-4 requests/second
- **Failure mode:** Out of memory (OOM) at 25+ users
- **Evidence:** Gunicorn workers killed by kernel

### Required for 100 users
- **VM:** e2-standard-2 ($49/month) - 8GB RAM
- **Database:** Cloud SQL db-f1-micro ($10/month)
- **Total infrastructure:** $59/month

## Observability Cost Comparison (Annual)

| Users | Prometheus + Grafana | Datadog Only | Savings |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| 10 | $11,700 | $4,122 | $7,578 |
| 100 | $12,708 | $4,830 | $7,878 |

**Key insight:** Engineer time ($150/hour) dominates costs.
Datadog's higher license fee is offset by 66% reduction in
maintenance time.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Memory, not CPU, was the bottleneck**
2. **Small VMs fail ungracefully under load** (OOM kills)
3. **Observability tooling consumes ~15-20% of RAM**
4. **Load testing revealed limits before production**
